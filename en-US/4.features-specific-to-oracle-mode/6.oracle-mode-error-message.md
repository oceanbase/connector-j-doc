Error messages in Oracle mode 
==================================================

This topic describes the error message structure and common error messages. 

Error message structure 
-----------------------------------------

In the regular error message structure, runtime information can be added to the end of the message, starting with a colon, as shown below:

```unknow
<error_message>:<extra_info>
```



The following example shows a `closed statement` error message, indicating that an exception is thrown during a call of the `next` method on a ResultSet object. 

```unknow
Closed Statement:next
```



In some cases, you can find the same information in the stack trace. 

Common error messages 
---------------------------------------

The following table describes the error messages by ORA ID.
