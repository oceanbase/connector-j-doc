# Close a database connection

After all operations are completed, the connection to the database must be closed. 

You can close the connection by using the `close` method of the Connection object:

```java
conn.close();
```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Usually, the <code>close</code> method is placed in the <code>finally</code> clause. </p>
</main>
