# Run queries and retrieve ResultSet objects
Statement objects use the `executeQuery` method to query the database. The method uses an SQL statement as input and returns a ResultSet object. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The method for executing a Statement object depends on the type of the SQL statement to be executed. If the Statement object indicates an SQL query that requires a ResultSet object be returned, the <code>executeQuery</code> method is applicable. If the SQL statement is a DDL or DML statement for updating the count, the <code>executeUpdate</code> method is applicable.  If the type of the SQL statement is unknown, the <code>execute</code> method is applicable. </li>
    <li>For OceanBase Connector/J, even if no ResultSet object is returned for the SQL string being executed, the executeQuery method does not throw an SQL exception. </li>
    </ul>
</main>


Example: Use the Statement object `st` to run a query and return a ResultSet object that contains content of the `name` column in the `customers` table. 

```java
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery ("SELECT name FROM customers");
```
