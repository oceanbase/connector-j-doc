Process ResultSet objects 
==============================================

After a query is executed, the ResultSet object traverses the results by using the `next()` method. 

This method can traverse the result set and detect whether the end of the result set is reached. 

During the traversal, you can use the `getXXX` method of the ResultSet object to extract data from the result set, where `XXX` corresponds to a Java data type. 

Example: Traverse the ResultSet object `rs` to retrieve and print the name of each customer. 

```java
while (rs.next()) {  
 System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
}
```



When the end of the result set is reached, the `next()` method returns `false`. Customer names are converted to Java string values.
