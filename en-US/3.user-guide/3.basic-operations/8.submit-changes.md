Commit changes 
===================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.7/submit-changes
Changes are automatically committed during DML operations, which is called the auto-commit mode. 

You can disable the auto-commit mode by calling the following method on the Connection object:

```java
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
```



If the auto-commit mode is disabled, you must call the following method on the Connection object to commit the changes:

```java
conn.commit();
```



You can also run the following command to roll back the changes:

```java
conn.rollback();
```



The `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` operation affects all DML statements executed since the last `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` operation. 
**Note**



An DDL operation will eventually result in an implicit `COMMIT` operation. If the auto-commit mode is disabled, the implicit `COMMIT` operation implicitly commits the DML operations that have not been explicitly committed or rolled back.
