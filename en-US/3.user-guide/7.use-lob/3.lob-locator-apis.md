LOB locator API 
====================================

Locators are small data structures that contain information for accessing actual data of large objects (`LOBs`). 

Locators are directly stored in database tables, while data can be stored in database tables or separately. Separate tablespaces are usually used for `LOBs`. 

OceanBase Connector/J can perform the `UPDATE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `READ` operations on an LOB after it obtains the locator of the `LOB`. You can enable or disable `LOB` locators by configuring the URL options. `supportLobLocator` is enabled by default. 

**LOB prefetch** 

OceanBase Connector/J prefetches metadata such as the `LOB` length, block size, and the start and locator of the `LOB` data during regular extraction operations to reduce the number of round trips. If a `LOB` column is selected for a result set, the server and OceanBase Connector/J support the prefetch of some or all data to the client when the locator is obtained. Then, subsequently read data is fetched from the prefetch buffer by API calls, without the need to make database round trips.
