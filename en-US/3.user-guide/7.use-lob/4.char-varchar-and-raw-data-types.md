CHAR, VARCHAR, and RAW data types

#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.7/char-varchar-and-raw-data-types
If you try to obtain a `CHAR`, `VARCHAR` or `RAW` column as a data stream without redefining the column type, OceanBase Connector/J returns a Java `InputStream` but does not actually transmit the stream. 

For these data types, OceanBase Connector/J extracts all data into an in-memory buffer when it calls the `executeQuery` or `next` method. The entry point of the `getXXXStream` method returns the streams that read data from the buffer.
