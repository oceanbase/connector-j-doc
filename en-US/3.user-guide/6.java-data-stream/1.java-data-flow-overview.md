Overview of Java data streams 
==================================================

OceanBase Connector/J supports two-way data stream operations between the server and the client. 

The driver supports conversion between the following types of data streams:

* Binary bits

  Apply to `RAW` bytes and correspond to the `getBinaryStream` method.
  




<!-- -->

* ASCII

  Applies to ASCII bytes in ISO-8859-1 encoding and corresponds to the `getAsciiStream` method.
  




<!-- -->

* Unicode

  Applies to Unicode bytes in UTF-16 encoding and corresponds to the `getUnicodeStream` method.
  




The `getBinaryStream`, `getAsciiStream`, and `getUnicodeStream` methods return the bytes in the InputStream object.
