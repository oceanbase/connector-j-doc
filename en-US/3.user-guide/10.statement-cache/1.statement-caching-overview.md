Overview of statement caching 
==================================================

Statement caching improves performance by caching repeatedly used executable statements, such as statements in loops or in repeatedly called methods. 

The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) standard defines a statement caching interface. 

Statement caching serves to:

* Save the overheads for repeatedly creating cursors.

  

* Prevent repeated statement parsing and creation.

  

* Reuse data structures in clients

  




Explicit statement caching can cache and retrieve specified prepared and callable statements. Explicit statement caching is dependent on a key, which is a Java `String` provided. 

Explicit statement caching retains the statement data, status, and metadata, thus providing high performance. During explicit statement caching, if OceanBase Connector/J fails to find a matching statement in the cache, `null` is returned.
