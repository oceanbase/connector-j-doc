# CHAR, VARCHAR, and RAW data types

If you try to obtain a `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, or `RAW` column as a data stream without redefining the column type, OceanBase Connector/J returns a Java `InputStream` but does not actually transmit the stream.

For these data types, OceanBase Connector/J extracts all data into an in-memory buffer when it calls the `executeQuery` or `next` method. The entry point of the `getXXXStream` method returns the streams that read data from the buffer.
