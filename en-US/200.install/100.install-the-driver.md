#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.7/install-the-driver
This topic describes how to install the OceanBase Connector/J driver and perform load and connection tests. Before the installation, make sure that the prerequisites are met. 

Prerequisites 
-------------------------------

* Before you install OceanBase Connector/J, set up the basic database development environment, and make sure that the Java environment on your computer is JDK 8.

  

* You have obtained the installation package of the OceanBase Connector/J driver from OceanBase Technical Support.

  




Load the installation package 
-----------------------------------------------

Place the JAR installation package of OceanBase Connection/J in a local directory. Use `cmd` to import the JAR package and then perform the following connection tests. 

1. Compile the Java sample file `HelloWorld.java` and load the driver class. 

   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          try {
              Class.forName("com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver");
          } catch (Throwable e) {
              e.printStackTrace();
          }
      }
   }
   ```

   

2. Run the following command to compile the Java sample file:

   ```java
   javac -cp target/oceanbase-client-{version}.jar HelloWorld.java
   ```

   
   **Note**

   

   You can change the compilation path as needed.
   

3. Run the following command to run the Java sample file:

   ```java
   java -cp .:target/oceanbase-client-{version}.jar HelloWorld
   ```

   




If all the preceding steps are performed and no error is returned, the JAR package of the OceanBase Connector/J driver is loaded correctly.
