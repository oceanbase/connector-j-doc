LOB locator API 
====================================

Locators are small data structures that contain information for accessing actual data of large objects (LOBs). 

Locators are directly stored in database tables, while data can be stored in database tables or separately. Separate tablespaces are usually used for `LOBs`. 

The OceanBase JDBC driver (OceanBase Client) can perform the `UPDATE TRUNCATE` and `READ` operations on the LOB after obtaining an LOB locator. You can enable or disable LOB locators by configuring the URL options. `supportLobLocator` is enabled by default. 

**LOB prefetch** 

OceanBase Client prefetches metadata (such as the `LOB` length, block size, and the start and locator of the `LOB` data) during regular extraction operations to reduce the number of round trips. If the `LOB` column is selected in the result set, the server and JDBC driver allow you to prefetch some or all data to the client when obtaining the locator. Then, the read API call retrieves data from the prefetch buffer without a database round trip.
