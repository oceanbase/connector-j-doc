LOB data types 
===================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.3/lob-data-type
A large object (LOB) is a data item that is too large to be directly stored in a database table. The workaround is to store a locator in the database table. The locator points to the actual location of the data item. 

The JDBC driver supports the following LOB data types by using streams:

* Binary large objects (`BLOBs`), which correspond to unstructured binary data

  

* Character large objects (`CLOBs`), which correspond to character data

  

* National character large objects (`NCLOBs`), which correspond to national character data

  




`LOB` behaviors are different from those of other types of streaming data described in this chapter. `LOB` data is not directly stored in a table. Only the locator is. You can use the locator to manipulate the actual data, including reading and writing data as a stream. Even during the streaming transmission of LOB data, only necessary data is moved on the network. However, during the streaming transmission of `LONG` or `LONG RAW` data, all data are moved on the network. 

When you query to get one or more `BLOB`, `CLOB`, or `NCLOB` columns, the JDBC driver transfers the data to the client so that the data stream can be accessed.
