The OceanBase JDBC driver (OceanBase Client) supports two-way data stream operations between the server and the client. 

The JDBC driver supports conversion between the following types of data streams:

* Binary bits

  Applies to `RAW` bytes and corresponds to the `getBinaryStream` method.
  




<!-- -->

* ASCII

  Applies to ASCII bytes in ISO-Latin-1 encoding and corresponds to the `getAsciiStream` method.
  




<!-- -->

* Unicode

  Applies to Unicode bytes in UTF-16 encoding and corresponds to the `getUnicodeStream` method.
  




The `getBinaryStream`, `getAsciiStream`, and `getUnicodeStream` methods return the bytes in the `InputStream` object.
