Commit changes 
===================================

Changes are automatically committed during DML operations, which is called the auto-commit mode. 

You can disable the auto-commit mode by calling the following method on the `Connection` object:

```unknow
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
```



If the auto-commit mode is disabled, you must call the following method on the `Connection` object to commit the changes:

```unknow
conn.commit();
```



You can also run the following command to roll back the changes:

```unknow
conn.rollback();
```



The `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` operation affects all DML statements executed since the last `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` operation. 
**Note**



* If the auto-commit mode is disabled and the connection is disabled without explicitly committing or rolling back the last changes, an implicit `COMMIT` operation is run.

  

* An DDL operation will eventually result in an implicit `COMMIT` operation. If the auto-commit mode is disabled, the implicit `COMMIT` operation implicitly commits the DML operations that have not been explicitly committed or rolled back.
