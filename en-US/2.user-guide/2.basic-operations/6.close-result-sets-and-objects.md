Close ResultSet and Statement objects 
==========================================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.0/close-result-sets-and-objects
The ResultSet and Statement objects must be explicitly closed after the operation is complete. 

This requirement applies to all `ResultSet` and `Statement` objects created by using the OceanBase JDBC driver (OceanBase Client). 

The JDBC driver has no post-processing mechanism. Therefore, routines of the `ResultSet` and `Statement` classes are cleared by using the `close` method. If the `ResultSet` or `Statement` object is not explicitly closed, serious memory leaks may occur and cursors in the database may be exhausted. After both the `ResultSet` and `Statement` objects are closed, the corresponding cursor in the database is released. When only the ResultSet object is closed, the cursor is not released. 

Example: Disabling both the `ResultSet` object `rs` and `Statement` object `st`. 

```unknow
rs.close();
st.close();
```
