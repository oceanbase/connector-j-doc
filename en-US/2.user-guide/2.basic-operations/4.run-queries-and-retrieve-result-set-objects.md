Run queries and retrieve ResultSet objects 
===============================================================

The Statement object uses the `executeQuery` method to query the database. The method uses an SQL statement as input and returns a JDBC ResultSet object. 
**Note**



* The method for executing the `Statement` object depends on the type of the SQL statement to be executed. If the `Statement` object indicates an SQL query that requires a `ResultSet` object be returned, the `executeQuery` method is applicable. If the SQL statement is a DDL or DML statement for updating the count, the `executeUpdate` method is applicable. If the type of the SQL statement is unknown, the `execute` method is applicable.

  

* For a standard JDBC driver, if no `ResultSet` object is returned for the SQL string being executed, the `executeQuery` method throws an SQL exception. For the OceanBaseJDBC driver (OceanBase Client), even if no `ResultSet` object is returned for the SQL string being executed, the `executeQuery` method does not throw an SQL exception.

  




Example: Using the `Statement` object `st` to run a query and return a `ResultSet` object that contains content of the `name` column in the `customers` table 

```unknow
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery ("SELECT name FROM customers");
```
