Error messages in Oracle mode 
==================================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.6/oracle-mode-error-message
This topic describes the error message structure and general JDBC error messages. 

Error message structure 
-----------------------------------------

In the regular JDBC error message structure, runtime information can be added to the end of the message, starting with a colon, as shown below:

```unknow
<error_message>:<extra_info>
```



The following example shows a `closed statement` error message, indicating that an exception is thrown during a call of the `next` method (ResultSet object). 

```unknow
Closed Statement:next
```



In some cases, you can find the same information in the stack trace. 

General JDBC error messages 
---------------------------------------------

The following table describes the JDBC error messages by ORA ID.
