Result set performance 
===========================================

OceanBase JDBC uses the client cache to provide scrollable result sets.

The basic server does not support scrollable cursors. Therefore, OceanBase JDBC must achieve scrollability in a separate layer and store the rows of scrollable result sets in the client cache. 

All rows of a scrollable result set are stored in the client cache, so the result set contains many rows. If many columns or very large columns exist, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on the client may fail. Therefore, we recommend that you do not specify scrollability for large result sets.
