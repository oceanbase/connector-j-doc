Run queries and retrieve ResultSet objects 
===============================================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.7/run-queries-and-retrieve-result-set-objects
Statement objects use the `executeQuery` method to query the database. The method uses an SQL statement as input and returns a ResultSet object. 
**Note**



* The method for executing a Statement object depends on the type of the SQL statement to be executed. If the Statement object indicates an SQL query that requires a ResultSet object be returned, the `executeQuery` method is applicable. If the SQL statement is a DDL or DML statement for updating the count, the `executeUpdate` method is applicable. If the type of the SQL statement is unknown, the `execute` method is applicable.

  

* For OceanBase Connector/J, even if no ResultSet object is returned for the SQL string being executed, the `executeQuery` method does not throw an SQL exception.

  




Example: Use the Statement object `st` to run a query and return a ResultSet object that contains content of the `name` column in the `customers` table. 

```java
ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery ("SELECT name FROM customers");
```
