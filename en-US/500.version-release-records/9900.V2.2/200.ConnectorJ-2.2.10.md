# OceanBase Connector/J V2.2.10

## Version information

* Release date: June 30, 2022

* Version: V2.2.10

## Overview

OceanBase Connector/J V2.2.10 supports the LoadBalance feature and is more compatible with MySQL and Oracle. This version applies to general businesses. 

## Enhanced features

* This version supports load balancing. You can specify the random, weighted, or round-robin strategy in the URL or configuration file for connection load balancing. In addition, you can create load balancing groups and blacklist strategies to improve availability and security. 

* The sendConnectionAttributes() method is provided to control whether to send additional attributes when a connection is created, to support more needs for users with different privileges. 

## Fixed issues

* The getWarnings() method returns null when an error occurs in MySQL mode. 

* The ColumnType values of BLOB and TEXT data types in MySQL mode are inconsistent with those in MySQL databases. 

* When a connection is closed in MySQL mode, the checkClose() behaviors of statement-related APIs are inconsistent with those in MySQL databases. 

* When the REF CURSOR data type is used in Oracle mode, the ResultSet.close() API fails to disable the cursor. As a result, cursors in OceanBase Database are not released in a timely manner in some cases. 

* Lock issues may be triggered by the setTransactionIsolation() API.
