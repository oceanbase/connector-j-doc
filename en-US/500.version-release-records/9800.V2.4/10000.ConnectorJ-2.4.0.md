# OceanBase Connector/J V2.4.0

## Version information

* Release date: October 18, 2022

* Version: V2.4.0

## Overview

OceanBase Connector/J V2.4.0 supports the OB2.0 protocol and coordinates with OceanBase Database and OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) to provide Full-link Trace. The version is recommended for general businesses. We recommend that you use it with OceanBase Database V4.0.0. 

## Enhanced features

* The OB2.0 protocol is supported. You can use the `useOceanBaseProtocolV20` parameter to enable or disable the protocol. By default, the protocol is enabled. 

* This version provides Full-link Trace in coordination with OceanBase Database and ODP. You can use the `enableFullLinkTrace` parameter to enable or disable the feature. By default, the feature is disabled. When `enableFullLinkTrace` is set to `true`, `useOceanBaseProtocolV20` is forcibly set to `true`. 

## Fixed issues

* When network fluctuations occur, the following exception is reported for the load balancing of the daemon thread: `No active connection found for master`. 

* The ArrayBinding setNull API causes the server to return exceptions. 

* If both the PreparedStatement and PrepareExecute protocols are enabled, when a procedure is recursively called, PreparedStatement is closed only at the first time.
