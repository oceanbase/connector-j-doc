# Connect Python applications to OceanBase Database

OceanBase Connector/J connects Python-based applications to OceanBase Database. This topic describes the prerequisites and connection procedure.

## Prerequisites

* A basic database development environment is deployed.

* You have installed or upgraded to JDK 8 on your computer.

* The Python environment on your computer is version 3.6.8.

* You have obtained the installation package of the OceanBase Connector/J driver from OceanBase Technical Support.




## Procedure

1. Install JayDeBeApi. We recommend that you install JayDeBeApi with pip. For more information, see [Install JayDeBeApi with pip](https://pypi.org/project/JayDeBeApi/).

2. Place the JAR installation package of OceanBase Connection/J in a local directory.

3. Create a test object in the database. Example:

   ```java
   CREATE TABLE test_python(id NUMBER, name VARCHAR2(20));
   INSERT INTO test_python VALUES (1, 'test1');
   INSERT INTO test_python VALUES (2, 'test2');
   COMMIT;
   ```


4. Establish a connection with OceanBase Database. Enter the corresponding parameter information in the Python code as follows. If valid running results are returned, the connection to the database is established.

   * In the `url` field, enter the corresponding IP address and port number.

   * In the `driver` field, enter the classpath.

   * In the `jarFile` field, enter the path of the JAR installation package.




   ```java
   #!/usr/bin/env python3.6
   # -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
   encoding = "utf8"
   import jaydebeapi
   def ob_test():     //ob_test() is a custom Python project name.
           url = 'jdbc:oceanbase://host:port/database'
           user = 'testUser'
           password = '******'
           driver = 'com.alipay.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver'
           jarFile = './oceanbase-client-2.4.3.jar'
           sqlStr = 'select * from test_python'     // SQL test statement
           # conn=jaydebeapi.connect('oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver','jdbc:oracle:thin:@127.XXX.XXX.XXX:1521/orcl',['hwf_model','hwf_model'],'E:/pycharm/lib/ojdbc14.jar')
           conn = jaydebeapi.connect(driver, url, [user, password], jarFile)
           curs = conn.cursor()
           curs.execute(sqlStr)
           result = curs.fetchall()
           print(result)
           curs.close()
           conn.close()
   ob_test()
   ```
