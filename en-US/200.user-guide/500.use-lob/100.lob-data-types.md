Overview of LOB data types 
===============================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.3/lob-data-types
OceanBase Database supports three large object (LOB) data types. 

Description of the three `LOB` data types:

* Binary large object (`BLOB`)

  This data type is used for unstructured binary data.
  




<!-- -->

* Character large object (`CLOB`)

  This data type is used for character data.
  




<!-- -->

* National character large object (`NCLOB`)

  This data type is used for national character data.
  




`BLOBs`, `CLOBs`, and `NCLOBs` are permanently stored in database tablespaces. All operations performed on these data types are controlled by transactions. 

PL supports the `LOB` data types. The JDBC API allows you to pass `IN` parameters to PL stored procedures or functions and retrieve `OUT` parameters or returned values.
