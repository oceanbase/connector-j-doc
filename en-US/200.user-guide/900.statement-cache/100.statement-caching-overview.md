Statement caching overview 
===============================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.0/statement-caching-overview
Statement caching improves performance by caching repeatedly used executable statements, such as statements in loops or in repeatedly called methods. 

The JDBC standard defines a statement caching interface. 

Statement caching can achieve the following effects:

* Save the overheads for repeatedly creating cursors.

  

* Prevent repeated statement parsing and creation.

  

* Reuse data structures in clients

  




Explicit statement caching can cache and retrieve specified statements that are prepared and callable. Explicit statement caching is dependent on the key, which is a Java `String` provided. 
**Note**



Normal statements cannot be cached.

Explicit statement caching retains the statement data, status, and metadata, thus providing high performance. During explicit statement caching, if the JDBC driver fails to find a matching statement in the cache, it returns `null`.
