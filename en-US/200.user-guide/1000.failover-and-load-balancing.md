Failover and load balancing 
================================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.6/failover-and-load-balancing
OceanBase JDBC supports three failover and load balancing modes: sequential, loadbalance, and replication. 

sequential 
----------------------------

The `sequential` mode supports connection failover in a multi-host environment. This mode does not allow secondary servers to handle read queries for load balancing. JDBC attempts to connect to the hosts in the sequence specified in the connection URL, so the first available host is used for all queries.
Sample connection URL:

```unknow
jdbc:oceanbasedb:sequential:host1,host2,host3,host4/testobdb
```



JDBC first attempts to connect to `host1`. If the host is unavailable, JDBC attempts to connect to `host2`. When a host fails, JDBC attempts to reconnect to the host in the same sequence. 

loadbalance 
-----------------------------

The `loadbalance` mode supports connection load balancing in a multi-host environment. This mode does not allow secondary servers to handle read queries for load balancing. JDBC randomly selects a host from each connection URL for load balancing on all queries. The connections are randomly distributed across all hosts, achieving load balancing on queries. 

replication 
-----------------------------

The `replication` mode supports connection load balancing in a primary/secondary deployment. This mode applies to environments with one or more hosts. This mode allows secondary servers to handle read queries if the connection is set to read-only. JDBC randomly selects a secondary server from the connection URL to handle read queries for load balancing. 

Parameters 
----------------------------

The following table describes the parameters. 


|        **Parameter**        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| autoReconnect               | If this parameter is enabled and no failover or load balancing mode is in use, JDBC attempts to reconnect to the host after a connection fails, which is called basic failover.  If this parameter is enabled and a failover and load balancing mode is in use, JDBC blacklists the failed host and attempts to connect to other hosts of the same type, which is called standard failover.  Default value: `false`.     |
| retriesAllDown              | If all hosts are down during a failover, this parameter is used to define the maximum number of connection retries for JDBC to avoid exceptions.  Default value: 120.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| failoverLoopRetries         | When JDBC silently searches for available hosts, this parameter specifies the maximum number of connection retries for JDBC, which prevents JDBC from searching forever and causing exceptions. This parameter is different from `retriesAllDown`. The silent search is used for temporary solutions of JDBC. For example, the primary connection is used to handle read queries when a secondary connection fails.  Default value: 120. |
| validConnectionTimeout      | When multiple hosts are configured, JDBC holds the verification connection within the specified duration (in seconds). When this parameter is set to 0, no verification is performed.  Default value: 120.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| loadBalanceBlacklistTimeout | When a connection fails, the host is added to the blacklist and blocked for the duration defined by this parameter (in seconds). JDBC preferentially attempts to connect to a host that is not on the blacklist, and attempts to connect to a blocked host only when no host is found.  The blacklist is shared within the class loader.  Default value: 50.                                                             |
| assureReadOnly              | If this parameter is enabled when a failover and load balancing mode is in use and a read-only connection is established to the host, the session is set to read-only to ensure that the connection is in read-only mode.  Default value: `false`                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| allowMasterDownConnection   | If this parameter is enabled in `replication` mode, a connection can be created when the primary server is down. If no primary server is available, JDBC connects to a secondary server, and `Connection.isReadOnly()` returns `true`.  Default value: `false`.                                                                                                                                                                          |
