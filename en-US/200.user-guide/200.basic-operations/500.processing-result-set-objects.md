Process a ResultSet object 
===============================================
#docslug#/connector-j/connector-j/V2.2.6/processing-result-set-objects
After a query is run, the ResultSet object traverses the results by using the next() method. 

This method can traverse the resultset and detect whether the end of the resultset is reached. 

During traversal, you can use the `getXXX` method of the `ResultSet` object to extract data from the resultset. `XXX` corresponds to a Java data type. 

Example: Traversing the `ResultSet` object `rs`, retrieving the name of each customer, and printing the names 

```unknow
while (rs.next())   System.out.println (rs.getString(1));
```



When the end of the resultset is reached, the `next()` method returns `false`. Customer names are materialized as Java `String` values.
