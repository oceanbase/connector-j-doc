## Overview

OceanBase Connector/J V2.2.6 supports the SEND PIECE feature and the `COM_STMT_PREPARE_EXECUTE` protocol. This version applies to general businesses.

## Enhanced features

- OceanBase Connector/J V2.2.6 supports `SEND PIECE` in Oracle mode.
- OceanBase Connector/J V2.2.6 supports `COM_STMT_PREPARE_EXECUTE` in Oracle mode.

## Fixed issues

- When the default value of `prepareCall` is retained, metadata building errors occur.
- If `characterEncoding` is set to `gbk` for the connection string of a tenant that uses the GBK character set, garbled display occurs.
- The `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` and `useServerPrepStmts=false` features are mutually exclusive.
- JDBC fails to load classes due to different Guava versions.
- The values of `getColumns` and `getTables` are case-sensitive, which is inconsistent with Oracle.
- The `call xxx` syntax is not supported for a stored procedure or function that has no parameters.
- If `useServerPrepStmts` is set to `true` for a connection string, errors occur when `zonedDateTime` data is inserted.
- The error code `ORA-00900` is returned if a `CALL` statement is not appended with parentheses "()".
